# campus-eats-app

This app was initially created during Spring Semester of 2019 at OSU, in collaboration with the D3 club.
There were three members in the group that created it: Myself, who contributed in programming and public
speaking roles, Joseph O'Neil, who contributed much of the code that makes up this app and did a demo of
it, and Jake Ryan, who contributed in presenting.

The aim of this app is to allow students to log meals eaten on-campus more efficiently, by utilizing the
pre-existing OSU nutrition database. At initial commit, it had a basic meal logging system and database
set up. In the future, I aim to continue developing it in the interest of making something like this for
my own personal use.
